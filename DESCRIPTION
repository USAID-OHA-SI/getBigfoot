Description: This package consists of several functions designed to assist with triangulating between the MSD, SC FACT, and PPMR. 
    Note that it requires access to the USAID OHA Google Drive. Functions get_MER() and get_ppmr() download and perform basic cleaning on 
    their associated datasets. Function get_scfact() only downloads the SC FACT dataset and requires subsequent use of sc_fact_df() to clean it.
    Cleaning is minimal and primarily intended to prepare the relevant datasets for merging using a *_join() operation. Following the proper procedure,
    users should be able to compare data from each set across standardized sites and periods for which overlapping data exists.
